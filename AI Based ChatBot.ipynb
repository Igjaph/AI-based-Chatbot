Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast volumes of data and use billions of parameters to generate original output for tasks like answering questions, translating languages, and completing sentences. RAG extends the already powerful capabilities of LLMs to specific domains or an organization's internal knowledge base, all without the need to retrain the model. It is a cost-effective approach to improving LLM output so it remains relevant, accurate, and useful in various contexts."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cr862W-a_boT"},"source":["## Step 1: Installed required libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":5302,"status":"ok","timestamp":1771674644680,"user":{"displayName":"Olubusayo Japhet","userId":"14712706757942886797"},"user_tz":0},"id":"wa2Br90I_v-x"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Install required libraries (runs once per runtime)\n","!pip install -q transformers sentence-transformers torch"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Zg1bWHYf_xKG"},"source":["## Step 2: Mount Google Drive and Load Documents\n","\n","**Before running this notebook:**\n","1.
